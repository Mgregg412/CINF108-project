Number_guessing_game.py:
  
  For this project, I created a game where you guess a random number between one and twenty-five. 
  With this, I was also trying to add a feature where three numbers above or below the selected number will give you another guess and tell you you have earned another guess.

Magic_conch_bonus_lab.py:
  
  For this project,t I used import ART and random.
  I created a program that took a list of random names (names.txt) that were imputed by the user, chose three to be displayed in the art text, and added a conch shell emoji (\U0001F41A)
